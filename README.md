# Solar Data
This is repo is created to host the simple Python script I wrote to scrape data such as the Direct Normal Irradiation and temperature. It can further be expanded to get more data.

To use the script, install Python and run <b>'solar.py'</b>

<b>Dependencies: Selenium Gecko Driver (gecko.exe)</b>
